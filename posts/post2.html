      <li><strong>Be patient and iterate:</strong> Generating the exact video you envision can take many attempts and hours of tweaking prompts【630868101519224†L52-L56】.</li>
      <li><strong>Understand model capabilities:</strong> Veo’s different versions offer different modes. Veo 3 supports dialogue and audio, while earlier versions provide frame-to-video or ingredients-to-video.

      <li><strong>Use AI to craft prompts:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help you design more detailed prompts before generating your video【630868101519224†L66-L70】.</li>
      <li><strong>Expect variability:</strong> Character consistency and unusual camera angles remain challenging. Some users report better results by keeping descriptions consistent and generating many versions【630868101519224†L70-L84】.</li>
